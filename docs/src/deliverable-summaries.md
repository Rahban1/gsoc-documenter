## Community Bonding Period

We had our first meeting, and we discussed what would be the flow of the entire internshiop and also discussed how to go about the first deliverable as per the proposal which is **Adding Search Benchmarks**.  

We discussed what should be the language of choice for writing scripts for benchmarking, we had two possible candidates, one was Julia (for obvious reasons, since the whole repo is in Julia) and the other one was JavaScript since the search functionality is implemented in JavaScript so it would be easier to interact with the search functionality.  

We talked about it and thought of JavaScript as a better choice but now I think of it, I belive the barebone architecture for benchmarks should be in Julia only so that in future if anybody want to add more benchmarks or new tests they can do it easily as I am expecting most of the people coming in the Documenter repo are coming from Julia background and as far as talking to the JavaScript based search functionality we can see how to talk it through Julin in coming days.
