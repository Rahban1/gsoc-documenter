# Improving Search functionality for Documenter.jl

This site is a collection of notes, progress reports for the [2025 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/KGUrSI9I) by [@Rahban1](https://github.com/Rahban1), mentored by [@mortenpi](https://github.com/mortenpi) and [@Hetarth02](https://github.com/Hetarth02).

I thought it would be a good idea to document my journey using Documenter itself, also I was inspired by my mentor Morten who did the same :)
