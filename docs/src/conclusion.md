# Conclusion

This marks the completion of my internship, this was an absolutely thrilling and exciting experience, I got the opportunity to learn a ton here, especially from my mentors [Morten Piibeleht](https://github.com/mortenpi) and [Hetarth Shah](https://github.com/Hetarth02).

I am eternally grateful to Google and Julia for giving me this opportunity to intern at such a prestigious organisation with such talented people.

I want to sincerely thank my mentors who supported me, helped me and guided me. I won't be able to do this without their support so thank you so much for your kindness.

I hope to be a part of this community and contribute to it with the best of my capabilities as much as I can.
